      "summary": "We present an ASIC implementation of two post-quantum public-key cryptosystems (PKCs): NTRU-Encrypt and TTS. It represents a first step toward securing machine-to-machine (M2M) systems using strong, hardware-assisted PKC. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that PKC is too expensive for M2M sensors, it actually can lower the total cost of ownership because of cost savings in provision, deployment, operation, maintenance, and general management."

      "summary": "MIFARE Classic is a proprietary contactless smart card technology widely used in public transportation ticketing systems of cities across the world. MIFARE Classic's cryptographic protection to the stored data has been reverse-engineered and broken in a recent series of papers. In this paper, we report our experience attacking a real MIFARE Classic system. Specifically, we have implemented a brute-force search using NVIDIA graphics cards to verify the claims in the literature. To our best knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a practical long-range attack. These attacks disarm all cryptographic protection of MIFARE Classic, making it extremely difficult to secure transactions. Lastly, we take up the challenge and present our ideas how to defend against most attacks using practical mechanisms that do not require any hardware changes."

We capture and analyze the communication between a legitimate reader and an EasyCard using GNURadio, an open-source software-defined radio running on PC. We will share our experiences with EasyCard security and hopefully provide some insights into RFID security in practice."
