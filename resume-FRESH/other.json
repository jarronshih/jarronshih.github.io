      "summary": "We report our experience attacking a real MIFARE Classic system. Specifically, we have implemented a brute-force search using NVIDIA graphics cards to verify the claims in the literature. To our best knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a practical long-range attack. These attacks disarm all cryptographic protection of MIFARE Classic, making it extremely difficult to secure transactions. Lastly, we take up the challenge and present our ideas how to defend against most attacks using practical mechanisms that do not require any hardware changes."

      "summary": "We present an ASIC implementation of two post-quantum public-key cryptosystems (PKCs): NTRU-Encrypt and TTS. It represents a first step toward securing machine-to-machine (M2M) systems using strong, hardware-assisted PKC. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that PKC is too expensive for M2M sensors, it actually can lower the total cost of ownership because of cost savings in provision, deployment, operation, maintenance, and general management."
