      "summary": "This paper report a experience attacking a real MIFARE Classic system. We implement a brute-force search using NVIDIA graphics cards to verify the claims in the literature. This is the first report in the literature of a practical long-range attack and these attacks disarm all cryptographic protection of MIFARE Classic. Lastly, we take up the challenge and present our ideas how to defend against most attacks using practical mechanisms that do not require any hardware changes."

      "summary": "This paper presents an ASIC implementation of two post-quantum public-key cryptosystems: NTRU-Encrypt and TTS. It represents a first step toward securing machine-to-machine systems using strong, hardware-assisted PKC. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that PKC is too expensive for M2M sensors, it lowers the total cost of ownership based on cost savings in provision, deployment, operation, maintenance, and general management."
