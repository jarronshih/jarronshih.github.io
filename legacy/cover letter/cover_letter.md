I am confident that my experience and skills provide me with the capability to complement with and contribute to TARGET's expertise and culture.


<!-- Skill set -->

My skill in cloud platform development is affirmed.
In SrcureCloud, I extend the support platform from VMWares to AWS, Azure and HP-cloud for potential customers.
I am also responsible for boot volume encryption  feature which places our product in the leading position.
Also, <!-- boot sequence, multi linux platform -->

My work in this area gave me a superb opportunity to establish and maintain excellent relationships with clients and coworkers at all levels.

By sprint retrospective, we decrease the time spent on daily Scrum meeting to 10 minutes and
we also plan for interruptions to minimize the impact.
I value my role in an organization and everyone aspire to help each other as a team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  I look forward to contribute to TARGET’s future.


Sincerely,
